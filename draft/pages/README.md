# Draft Pages

This folder contains experimental page layouts and designs.

## Purpose
- Design and test different page structures
- Experiment with layouts and user flows
- Build static mockups without auth/database constraints
- Iterate quickly on UI concepts

## Structure
Create individual files for different page concepts:
- `homepage.tsx` - Landing page experiments
- `marketplace.tsx` - Main marketplace layout
- `product-detail.tsx` - Product page designs
- etc.

## Usage
These are standalone components focused purely on design. When you find layouts you like, integrate the concepts into the main `app/` folder structure.
