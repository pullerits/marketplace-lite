# Draft Components

This folder contains experimental/draft UI components for design exploration.

## Purpose
- Test new component designs
- Experiment with different layouts  
- Try different styling approaches
- Build without backend constraints

## Usage
Components here are standalone and don't need to integrate with the auth system or database. Focus purely on UI/UX.

When you find designs you like, copy the relevant code to the main `components/` folder.
